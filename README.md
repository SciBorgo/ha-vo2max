# The effects of heat acclimation and acclimatisation on maximal aerobic capacity in thermoneutral conditions: A Re-analysis of Waldron et al. (2020) published in Sports Medicine.

# Details for replication
Use 'data-waldron-et-al.xlsx' and 'replication-analysis-waldron-et-al.R' to reproduce the analysis reported in the origional review.
Use 'data-jb-db-extraction.xlsx' and 'main-reanalysis.R' to replicate our re-analysis.
Use 'data-jb-db-extraction.xlsx' and 'leave-one-out-reanalysis.R' to replicate our leave-one-out analysis.

# Analysis not reported in our article
Use 'data-jb-db-extraction.xlsx' and 'reanalysis-with-shvartz-untrained-control-groups.R' to replicate the re-analysis, but with the inclusion of the 'untrained' and 'control' groups from Shvartz, which were 'most similiar' in terms of VO2max.

# Calculation of non-parametric prediction interval, not reported in our article
The file 'non-parametric-prediction-interval.xlsx' was used to calculate a non-parametric prediction interval. This was not reported as it was very similiar to the parametric prediction interval reported in our article. For further reading, please see: Wang CC, Lee WC. A simple method to estimate prediction intervals and predictive distributions: summarizing meta‚Äêanalyses beyond means and confidence intervals. Research synthesis methods. 2019 Jun;10(2):255-66.
